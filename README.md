### Analytics interface for DFN Cameras
The work in this repository is for a separate "analytics" homepage hosted on each DFN camera.
The purpose of this is to visualise a camera's taken pictures, status and analytics
in an intuitive way, so that no expertise is needed to check up on your camera's
basic progress.

This will be using:
- HTML
- CSS (SASS, BOURBON)
- JS (Lightbox for image gallery)
- jQuery (for requests)

- web.py (for the backend)
